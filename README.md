java Main
📤 Output
After running the program, the output will display the traversal of the maze using DFS and BFS algorithms.
Sample Output:

Depth First Search Traversal:
0 1 3 4

Breadth First Search Traversal:
0 2 4 1

(Output order may vary based on graph structure)
✅ Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithms using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts.

DFS explores paths deeply before backtracking.

BFS explores all neighboring nodes level by level.

The project helps understand graph traversal techniques clearly.

It is useful for learning real-world applications like maze solving, path finding, and network traversal.
Overall, this project strengthens the understanding of graph-based algorithms
